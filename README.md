# mastermind_game
A terminal based clone of the classic mastermind codebreaker game.

mastermind is a classic board game made in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, but now, with major advancements in technology, it is playable from the command line!
with a powerful kotlin backend and inefficient code made as a kotlin training exercise, this mastermind clone breaks the norm and dares to take its own path: copy the exact gameplay mechanics of the original board game. 
die hard mastermind-kotlin-terminal-interface fans have been waiting for this moment for years.
